# Hotrod

This is a very small library (one function + one macro) that helps you live reload C code.
It should work fine on Unix systems. Patches for making it run on Windows are most welcome!

## How to use it

### 1. Include it
```c
#include "hotrod.h"
```

### 2. Use the HOTROD macro somewhere in your code where you want a hot-reloadable function
```c
int main() {
  HOTROD(mess, 100, "hello");
}
```

This is equivalent of the following normal function call. Remember to replace it with this in production!
```c
int main() {
  mess(100, "hello");
}
```

### 3. Compile your program and run it
This will create a file called 'hot_stuff.c'. In this file there will be a stub function for you to fill in. Every time the line with the macro is executed (and you have changed the source file), the code will recompile and a new version of the function will be loaded in.

## Example
Check out 'example.c' in this repository.

## Extra options
There are a few extra options you can set from anywhere in your program.

The directory where the hotrod *.c and *.so files should be stored.
```c
hotrod_dir = "./temp";
```

A NULL terminated list of extra include files.
```c
hotrod_extra_includes = (char*[]) { "my_engine.h", "gfx.h", NULL };
```

A flag to enable printing of compiler command.
```c
hotrod_print_compile_command = true;
```

A variable for changing (or removing) the prefix for files emitted by hotrod.
```c
char *hotrod_prefix = "";
```

A variable for changing what compiler to use (default is clang).
```c
char *hotrod_compiler = "gcc";
```
